# Python-2048-Neural-Network-Solver
Trains a feed forward neural network through reinforcement learning to solve https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/.

#TODO
Selecting which networks to bring forward to the next generation/breed from
Remake 2048 game (currently horrible - but working - code)
Make a class pairing each network with a game to run on
Toggle for visualisation (to see the trained networks in action)

#IMPLEMENTED
Neural Network
2048 Game
